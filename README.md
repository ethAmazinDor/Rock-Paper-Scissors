# Rock-Paper-Scissors Javascript

This is a Rock Paper Scissors project!

I learned alot about defining variables, seperating different actions in different functions, and parameters. Also learned how to use callback functions and how to manipulate the DOM through javascript.  It took roughly 10 hours to write the JavaScript code for this.

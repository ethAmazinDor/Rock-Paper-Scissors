# Rock-Paper-Scissors Javascript

This is a Rock Paper Scissors project!

I learned alot about paramaters/calling functions/defining variables. Also learned how to use callback functions and how to manipulate the DOM through javascript.  It took roughly 10 hours to write the JavaScript code for this.
